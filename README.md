**Project Overview:**
This project aims to predict income levels based on demographic and professional features like age, job role, education, and more. Using machine learning, particularly the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, this project investigates the factors that contribute to income disparities. It is designed to explore applications in analyzing income equality and identifying insights that could support fair pay policies.

What the Project Does
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed, with categorical variables encoded, and numerical features scaled. SMOTE is used to balance classes in the training data.
Model Training: The KNN model is trained on the balanced dataset to improve income classification performance.
Evaluation Metrics: The modelâ€™s performance is assessed using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score.
